# Movie-Recommendation-System
A simple recommendation system that ranks and suggests movies using machine learning, based on the user's favourite movie. This system utilizes the feature extraction tool TfidfVectorizer from the Scikit-learn library for transforming the information of the movies (e.g., tagline, cast, genre of movie) into feature vectors.
